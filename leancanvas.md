## Problem
Lack of Formal Address Systems: Many regions (like in Kenya) lack reliable address structures, making customer verification, deliveries, and logistics difficult.

Inefficient Deliveries: E-commerce and logistics businesses struggle with inaccurate or incomplete customer locations.

Governmental Planning Inefficiencies: Local governments lack accurate geolocation data for infrastructure, planning, and emergency response.


## Customer Segments

Financial Institutions: Banks, insurance providers, SACCOs, microfinance orgs.

E-commerce Companies: Online retailers, marketplaces, last-mile delivery services.

Logistics Providers: Courier services, freight, and postal companies.

Government Entities: Municipalities and national governments for urban planning and emergency services.
